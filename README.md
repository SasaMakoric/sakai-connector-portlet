# Sakai Connector Portlet

This portlet allows you to render tools from your Sakai environment inside uPortal.
It is completely configurable, and each user can choose a tool from any of their Sakai sites to display in the portal.

### Features
* Allows a seamless integration between Sakai and uPortal
* Uses Basic LTI and OAuth for a secure single-sign-on connection
* Can be configured by an administrator to only allow certain tools
* Supports the CONFIG portlet mode for rich configuration
* Completely configurable for users to select the tools from sites they want to render
